    <h1>Description:</h1>
    <p>Add risottos to your repertoire – they’re a tasty way to use up whatever you have in the fridge or freezer. This one is beautifully creamy and balanced with roasted vegetables.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400g gold sweet potato, peeled, cut into 2cm pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large zucchini, cut into 2cm pieces</li>
        <li>4 cups (1L) Coles Real Vegetable Stock</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (375ml) water</li>
        <li>25g Coles Australian Butter</li>
        <li>1 brown onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>125g white cup or flat mushrooms, quartered</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, crushed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (300g) Coles Italian Arborio Rice</li>
        <li>100g frozen Coles Australian Peas</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (25g) Coles Shredded Parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220C. Combine the sweet potato and 1 tbsp oil in a small baking dish. Roast for 10 mins. Add zucchini and roast for 8-10 mins or until vegetables are lightly browned and tender.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring the stock and water to the boil in a medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter and remaining 1 tbsp oil in a large heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, mushroom and garlic and cook, stirring, for 3-4 mins or until onion softens. Add the rice. Cook, stirring, for 1 min or until the grains appear glassy. Reduce heat to low. Add the stock, 1 ladleful at a time. Stir with a wooden spoon until all the liquid has been absorbed. Repeat with remaining stock (this should take about 25 mins).</li>
        <li>Add sweet potato mixture and peas to rice mixture with the last ladleful of stock. Cook for 2-3 mins or until heated through (the rice should be tender but firm to the bite). Stir in the parmesan. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
